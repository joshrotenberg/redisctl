## Summary

### Progress Today
- Started with ~50% coverage
- Added **10 new command modules** in one session
- Achieved **74% coverage** of all Redis Enterprise handlers
- Created **7 PRs** with full documentation and tests

### Key Achievements
- **Complete async operation support** across all create/update/delete operations
- **Consolidated RBAC** - Combined users, roles, and ACLs into single cohesive module
- **Full documentation** - Every command has comprehensive mdBook documentation
- **Test coverage** - All commands have unit tests
- **Clean code** - All PRs pass linting and clippy checks

### Remaining Work
The 8 unimplemented handlers are mostly low-priority administrative functions:
- **Alerts** - Could be useful for monitoring integration
- **License** - Might be worth adding for license compliance checking
- **Bootstrap/Local/Services** - Very specialized, rarely used
- **OCSP/Debug** - Advanced features for specific scenarios

### Recommendation
The current 74% coverage includes all the critical operational commands. The remaining handlers are specialized administrative functions that most users won't need. Consider implementing:
1. **license.rs** - For license compliance monitoring
2. **alerts.rs** - For monitoring integration

The others can be added on-demand if users request them.
