# Release System Audit Report

## Current State

### üî¥ Critical Issues

1. **Duplicate Release Workflows**
   - `redisctl-release.yml` - Old cargo-dist workflow (triggers on `redisctl-v*` tags)
   - `v-release.yml` - New cargo-dist workflow (triggers on `v*` tags)
   - Both have the same name "Release" causing confusion

2. **Tag Push Trigger Failure**
   - GitHub Actions don't trigger when tags are pushed by other actions using GITHUB_TOKEN
   - The tag-on-merge workflow creates tags but can't trigger the release workflow
   - This is why v0.2.0 tag didn't trigger binary builds

3. **Missing Binaries**
   - Only macOS ARM64 binary was uploaded (built locally)
   - Should have 7 platform binaries:
     - macOS: x86_64, aarch64
     - Linux: x86_64-gnu, x86_64-musl, aarch64-gnu, aarch64-musl  
     - Windows: x86_64-msvc

### üü° Configuration Issues

1. **Tag Namespace Mismatch**
   - dist-workspace.toml uses `tag-namespace = "v"`
   - Old workflow expects `redisctl-v*`
   - New workflow expects `v*`

2. **Docker Workflow**
   - Configured correctly to trigger on `v*` tags and release events
   - Missing Docker Hub secrets (DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD)
   - Won't build containers until secrets are configured

3. **License File Issue**
   - dist-workspace.toml was expecting `LICENSE` but repo has `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`
   - Fixed locally but needs to be committed

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **Prepare Release Workflow** - Successfully bumps versions and creates PR
2. **Tag on Merge Workflow** - Successfully creates tags when release PRs merge
3. **Changelog Generation** - git-cliff properly generates CHANGELOG.md
4. **Manual Release Creation** - GitHub Release was created successfully

## Workflow Flow

```
1. prepare-release.yml (manual trigger)
   ‚Üì
2. Creates PR with version bumps
   ‚Üì
3. PR merged
   ‚Üì
4. tag-on-merge.yml creates tag
   ‚Üì
5. ‚ùå v-release.yml SHOULD trigger (but doesn't due to GITHUB_TOKEN)
   ‚Üì
6. ‚ùå docker.yml SHOULD trigger (but doesn't)
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Remove duplicate workflow**
   ```bash
   rm .github/workflows/redisctl-release.yml
   ```

2. **Add workflow_dispatch to v-release.yml** (already done locally)
   - Allows manual triggering with tag input

3. **Use PAT for tag creation**
   - Create a Personal Access Token with workflow permissions
   - Add as secret: RELEASE_TOKEN
   - Update tag-on-merge.yml to use it

4. **Commit the fixes**
   - Updated v-release.yml with workflow_dispatch
   - Updated dist-workspace.toml with correct license files

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - Keep only v-release.yml for releases
   - Ensure all workflows use consistent tag patterns

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Add a test job to verify release artifacts
   - Include checksums validation

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the release process in docs/
   - Include troubleshooting guide

## Current v0.2.0 Release Status

- ‚úÖ Tag created: v0.2.0
- ‚úÖ GitHub Release published
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Only 1/7 binaries uploaded (macOS ARM64)
- ‚ùå No Docker images built
- ‚ùå No installers generated

## Next Steps

1. Commit the local fixes
2. Manually trigger v-release.yml for v0.2.0
3. Monitor the build and upload of all 7 binaries
4. Set up Docker Hub secrets
5. Create PR with comprehensive fixes
